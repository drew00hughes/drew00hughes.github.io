        <h1>HEY</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Drew Hughes.
            I'm a web and software developer, a future computer science graduate, and an avid fun-haver.
            I am about to complete my B.S. in Computer Science at Auburn University in May 2021.
            Outside of school and work, I love to play musical instruments, hike, and rock climb. I also love to read and to cook!
            Please take a moment to explore, there's even a couple of hidden secrets on each page!
        </p>
        <p>In the meantime, here's a few fun things about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, and my favorite book series is his <em>Stormlight Archive</em></li>
            <li>My favorite movie is <em>Inception</em></li>
            <li>My favorite band as of right now is <em>Colony House</em></li>
            <li>I've been playing the piano for 16 years and I hope to continue playing it for (at least!) 16 more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Check out the About page to download my resume or the Projects page to view some of the sites I've had the pleasure of working on
            individually and through Auburn University.
        </p>
