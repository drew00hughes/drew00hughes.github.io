            <p>
                Pharmacy Scheduler is an application built around scheduling COVID-19 testing and vaccination
                appointments for Auburn University and eventually the greater Auburn-Opelika area. The
                purpose of this application is to allow medical administration to create testing and
                vaccination events to streamline the relief process. Users are invited to schedule an
                appointment on a certain day to be tested or vaccinated. This application includes an
                automatic email system based around the appointments. At the time of this writing, it is currently
                not public facing and only available to Auburn University students/faculty. 
                Here are a few pictures of site from an average user's perspective. (Click to enlarge)

                This application is the current main website for the Auburn University School of Nursing. Unlike the previous
                project, this is a very front-end focused website. Plus it's available for the public! So click the link above
                and give it a look.

            <p>
                The Auburn Answers project is an Auburn Student Government Association (SGA) initiative to increase
                student involvement with campus-wide decisions. Students, faculty, and others can fill out polls, submit
                questions and comments, and get in touch with SGA representatives. This project has a heavy back-end focus,
                particularly with allowing SGA administrators to interact with student's submissions and set up polls. Though this
                is primarily meant for Auburn students, it is available to the general public to interact with and submit responses
                related to Auburn's campus. Please click the link above and explore!

            <h2>SGA Voting</h2>
            <p>
                SGA elections at any university are always a very busy time. People everywhere campaigning for their candidate,
                plenty of platforms to view and speeches to attend, not to mention the craziness of voting day. This project was meant to
                consolidate all of those things into one central location. The SGA Voting application allows students to vote for their candidate
                of choice day-of using an easy, mobile-friendly online interface. Admins are able to setup elections and configure
                them to their needs as well as view demographics and reports following a big election. Students are able to vote with 3 simple clicks!
                A recent inclusion in this project was the ability to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting" target="_blank"><u><em>Ranked Choice</em></u></a> Elections, where voters can rank their top x choices,
                rather than be forced to only choose one candidate.
                While this is only open to Auburn University students, I've included a few screenshots below for you to see a voter's
                perspective.

            <h2>Flunch</h2>
            <p>
                Flunch is a portmanteau of the words "Faculty" and "Lunch". As the name may suggest, this application allows
                students and faculty to schedule free lunches anywhere on campus with one another. The goal is to allow
                students to garner better relationships with their professors and other faculty members. These "flunches" 
                are meant primarily for students to discuss grades, research, and other opportunities.
                Students may request up to three potential dates and times for a flunch, and faculty members may accept the
                invitation for one of the times or they may suggest a new time for them to meet. What better way to discuss your
                failing grade than over a free lunch on campus? This site is only for Auburn University members, so I've included
                some images below of the student's requesting process.
